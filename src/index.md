A collaborative effort to organize Matlab tools for the Oceanographic Community

## Time Series Tools

- [UTide](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/46523--utide--unified-tidal-analysis-and-prediction-functions?requestedDomain=www.mathworks.com): Expands and integrates the t_tide (Pawlowicz et al 2002), r_t_tide (Leffler and Jay 2009), and "versatile" (Foreman et al 2009) approaches into a common framework. From Dan Codiga.

- [jLab](https://github.com/jonathanlilly/jLab): A Matlab toolbox for big data analysis, signal processing, mapping, and oceanographic applications. From Jonathan Lilly.

- [RPSstuff](https://github.com/rsignell-usgs/RPSstuff/tree/master/RPSstuff): Tools for principal axis, low-pass filtering, z0tocd, and more.  From Rich Signell. 

- [rwt](https://github.com/ricedsp/rwt): Rice Wavelet Toolbox. 


## Numerical Modeling Tools

- [seagrid](https://github.com/rsignell-usgs/seagrid): Orthogonal curvilinear grid creator for Matlab, used to make grids for ROMS, COAWST, ECOM, etc.

## Mapping Tools

- [m_map](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html): A free mapping package. From Rich Pawlowicz. 


## Hydrographic Tools
- [teos-10](http://www.teos-10.org/software.htm): Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater (e.g. practical salinity, specific volume, potential density, etc). 
- [ez-krig](http://globec.whoi.edu/software/kriging/easy_krig/easy_krig.html): A gui-driven collection of routines to make Kriging of hydrographic and other spatial data a simple process, by Dr. Dezhang Chu.
- [lim](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/#LIM): Tools for water properties in lakes (or seawater < 4 ppt). From Rich Pawlowitz.


## Data Interface Tools

- [nctoolbox](http://nctoolbox.github.io/nctoolbox/): Provides read-only access to NetCDF, OPeNDAP, HDF5, GRIB, GRIB2, HDF4 and many (15+) other file formats and services using the same API.  Understands and utilizes CF Conventions to facilitate reading coordinate data (lon, lat, depth, time). 

## Atmosphere

- [air-sea](https://github.com/rsignell-usgs/air-sea): Compute surface wind stress and heat flux components from buoy and shipboard atmospheric and near-surface oceanographic time series measurements. By Rich Pawlowicz and Bob Beardlsley.



## Miscellaneous Other Tools

- [jLab](https://github.com/jonathanlilly/jLab): A Matlab toolbox for big data analysis, signal processing, mapping, and oceanographic applications. From Jonathan Lilly.

- [RPSstuff](https://github.com/rsignell-usgs/RPSstuff/tree/master/RPSstuff): Miscellaneous tools from Rich Signell (principal axis, low-pass filtering, z0tocd, etc).
